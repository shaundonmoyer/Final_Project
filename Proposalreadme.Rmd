# Final Project Proposal (Donmoyer)

## Objectives
The objective of this project is to integrate the data from the FracFocus registry into R for statistical analysis. A code will be developed that will be able to pull information on a given hydraulic fracking fluid ingredient from any specific state. The code will then be used for analysis on a given ingredient throughout the country.

## Data sources
The data source that will be used in this project is from an SQL database that can be downloaded here. Fracfocus.org is a public repository that hosts information on hydrualic fracking fluids from public disclosures. The database that fracfocus uses is an SQL database and can be downloaded as a backup database (or .bak file). The backup database can be restored using an SQl Server Management Studio application. Once the database is restored, multiple packages in R can be used to query from this database.

## Languages Used
This coding language that will be used for this project is R. An application (SQL Server Management Studio) will be used in the data restoration process instead of using R.
