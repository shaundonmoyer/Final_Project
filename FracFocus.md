# Manipulating FracFocus Data using R

Hydraulic fracking fluids are large solutions of chemicals used for recovering oil and gas in unconventional shale plays. The overall usage of specific chemicals in the industry is poorly understood by researchers, however a large database hosted by [Fracfocus.org](http://fracfocus.org/) reports hydraulic fracking fluid compositions in a manner that is unorganized and hard to sort through. The objective of this project is to develop a script(s) in R to query data from the Fracfocus registry to report on specific hydraulic fracking chemicals used by the industry. The script(s) will also be used to perform statistal analysis on specific ingredients to help understand which ingredients the industry as a whole is preferring to use along with the concentrations these chemicals are used during a hydraulic fracturing job. 

## Getting Started

The following information will provide you with the proper software and data needed to replicate this project along with detailed instructions.

### Prerequisites 

For this project the following software and data is needed:

* R
* RStuido
* Backup and restored version of the FracFocus Registry Database
* SQL Server Managment Studio (SSMS)


### Installing and Downloading R and Rstudio

This next paragraph will expain where and how to download and install R and RStudo.

### Obtaining SSMS(SQL Server Management Studio)

SSMS is an integrated environment for managing any SQL infrastructure. SSMS provides tools to configure, monitor
and produce/host instances of an SQL server and databases. To download SSMS, click [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15)
where you will be able to find an SSMS for your needs.


### Downloading and Restoring FracFocus Database

A replica database of the entire FracFocus registry is available for download as a backup file [Here](http://fracfocus.org/data-download). This data is updated the 15th of every month with the most recent disclosures. The download will contain a backup version of the Microsoft SQL Server 2012 database that provides the same information available through the FracFocus website. Once the database is downloaded, it must be restored (From its backup version to a useable file) using a SQL Server Managment Studio application. FracFocus includes detailed insturctions here on how to restore the backup database. In general, restoring the database includes importing the backup file into your SSMS and manipulating it by following the specific insturctions linked above.

Since the backup database was created using Microsoft SQL 2012, it is reccommended that the 2012 edition of SQL Server Managment Studio is used to restore the database. To download and install the proper edition of SSMS, follow the instructions found here. 

Explain how the server is a local host on your computer.

#### Structure of the FracFouc Database

Now that the database is retored and is located in the SSMS application, it is important to understand how the data is stored. Every disclosure in FracFoucs is composed of three different components all of which are stored in three different tables. The tables that you will find in the restored database include:

* RegistryUpload – This table contains each disclosure’s header information such as the job date, API number, location, base water volume, and total vertical depth.

* RegistryUploadPurpose – This table contains each disclosure’s additive names, suppliers, and the purposes for the additives used.

* RegisryUploadIngredients – This table contains each disclosure’s chemical information, where available, such as the CAS number and the maximum percentages in which they are found in the additive and job.

Using the SSMS application you can perform simple queries to sort through the extenisve FracFoucs registry. 

```
SELECT * FROM [FracFocusRegistry].[dbo].[RegistryUploadIngredients] WHERE IngredientName = 'Acetic Acid'
```
The above line of SQL code simply selects the RegistryUploadIngredients table and selects on the results where "Acetic Acid" is used in the IngredientName column. The same syntax can be applied to any table and column for any table in your SSMS to narrow down your data.

## Connecting R to SSMS

Querying data in SSMS is simple and straight forward, however manipulation of data is not. This is when applying R to your data becomes extremly useful. 

First we will need a package that will allow the connection to an Open Database Driver. The SSMS application is an Open database driver and the following package will be needed in R.

```
install.packages("odbc")
library(odbc)
```
Now we can use the dbConnect function in this package to connect R to our SSMS application. 

```
con <- dbConnect(odbc(),Driver="SQL Server",Server="your_server_name", Database="FracFocusRegistry", Trusted_Connection="True")
```

For this function you will need to provide the server name in which you are hosting the SSMS application and then the database in which you would like to connect to, in our case that is the "FracFocusRegistry". Once the connection is successful you will see a connection in the Connections tab in the upper right corner of Rstudio.


Now that a connection has been established to the FracFoucsRegistry in R through the SSMS application, we can now call in data from the FracFoucsRegistry into R. This can be done using the "dbGetQuery" function from the odbc package. This function uses the connection made above inconjuction with the SQL syntax you would use to query data in the SSMS application. Referring back to the 'Acetic Acid' query earlier, to bring those results into R as a data table the following code can be used.


First install the data.table package
```
install.packages("data.table")
library(data.table)
```

```
AceticAcid <- data.table(dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM RegistryUploadIngredients Where IngredientName = 'Acetic Acid';"))
```

The same results we yielded earlier as a query in the SSMS application, is now a data table in your global environment in R. The dbGetQuery function allows you query data directly from your SSMS and allocate the data into R.
